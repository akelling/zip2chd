Converts Zips to CHD files

What is a CHD:
A CHD is a lossless compression format originally developed for MAME, for the hard-drive contents of certain arcade machines. It has since been used in several other emulators as a means of storing CD-ROM game data. For CD-based games, it compresses the contents of a disc image (.cue + .bin files) to a single .chd file.

**I am not responsible for data lose! This script is provided AS IS.**

Copy the script to the directory that contains your .ZIP files and it will extract them and converting them to .CHD files. 
This will cut down your filesizes on supported consoles by a considerable some.
